# AddressBook

##Team: 

Carlos Paz, Matteo Prock

##Description: 

Web App for users to share their personal information and social media accounts with other users.
It will work as an Address Book where you can choose who can see your information and what information you share with each group of people.
For example for a coworker or a client you would choose to share with them your telephone number, work email and even LinkedIn profile but
for a family member or friend you would share your Facebook, Instagram and a personal email.

##How to: 

- Register with username, email and password to get access to the full application. 
- Add more information to your profile like phone number and social media channels. 
- Search for friends who are also registered with their username (e.g. “helmut123”, “xMatse”). 
- Add the person as a friend.
- See all your friends and their information in the Contacts page.
